# webdesign-nojavascript
Brew & Bloom Café is a cozy, visually rich single-page website built entirely with HTML and CSS, designed to capture the warm and inviting ambiance of a local coffee shop. The idea was inspired by my love for cafés and their comforting, aesthetic environments. I wanted to create a website that feels cozy and visually appealing, even without using any JavaScript functionality.

During the project, I focused on layout, typography, color palettes, and responsive design. I used CSS Grid and Flexbox to structure sections like the menu, hero banner, and about area. Hover effects on menu items and smooth gradient headers add subtle interactivity and depth, making the page engaging while remaining lightweight.

One of the biggest challenges was designing a visually rich page without relying on JavaScript for animations or interactions. I overcame this by leveraging pure CSS transitions, hover effects, and responsive techniques. The project taught me a lot about CSS creativity, spacing, alignment, and building polished designs with only HTML and CSS.
